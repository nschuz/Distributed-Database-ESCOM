 If we want to use ORDER BY in a query involving set operations, we must place the
ORDER BY at the end of the entire statement. The ORDER BY clause can appear
only once at the end of the compound query. The component queries can’t have
individual ORDER BY clauses. For example:
 */

UNION

rem Component queries are executed from top to bottom. If we want to alter the
rem sequence of execution, use parentheses appropriately.
